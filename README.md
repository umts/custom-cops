# CustomCops

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/custom-cops`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

TODO: Delete this and the text above, and describe your gem

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'custom-cops'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install custom-cops

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

To run the spec files, you'll need Rubocop's spec support methods. In order to achieve this, shallow clone Rubocop into the vendor directory locally:

    $ git clone --depth 1 git://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop.git vendor/rubocop
